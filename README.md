👋 Hey, I’m @marianella1 — think strategy meets code, with a dash of curiosity and spice.	 
🕰️ First gig? Y2K. When the world feared a financial digital apocalypse, I helped keep the lights on.	  
🔐 Currently deep-diving into Arabic and cyber security — because language and systems both deserve to be decoded.	  
📈 I bring a monetisation and trading lens to frontier tech — let’s build what’s next, and make it profitable. 	 
📬 Reach out via email — always open to sharp ideas and sharp minds.	 
💬 Pronouns: she/her	  
🍷 Fun fact: I once tried eating dinner at 6pm… and spent the rest of the evening wondering if it was a snack or a mistake.
